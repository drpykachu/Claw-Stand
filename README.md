### Hello all! 

### This project is inspired by the battle bots claw stand robot:

### Each finger in the claw contains 3 motors - Motor A, Motor B, and Motor C. Each motor has an angle it can rotate  - \theta_A, \theta_B, \theta_C. We need to perform inverse kinematics to find the angles need to obtain the positioning of the finger to a point in 3d-space - (X_p, Y_p, Z_p)
